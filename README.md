# Inverted index experiment

## TODO

- workspace
  - main package
    - MVP
      - filter by facet by numeric range
        - would allow better memoization
      - microbundle
      - errors and warnings
    - Post MVP
      - event dispatcher to allow async loading, async indexing
        - https://github.com/developit/mitt
      - facets optimization
        - single value columns filter
        - we can iterate over first page only
        - we can put selected values on top
        - for numeric facet for slider:
          - sort by value asc
          - don't care about selected values
      - memoization for consequent operations
        - search narrowing
        - pagination
        - sorting
      - highilght search results
      - search for facets
      - built-in prefix search based on TrieMap
        - through facet filter
      - sort by more than one column
      - web worker
      - date time columns
      - more than one level objects
    - Other
      - [BFloat16 wasm](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-float16array/issues/7)
      - RoaringWasm and other TrieMaps
      - hierarchical filter with TrieMap and custom separator (`/` instead of `>`)
        - But it needs a way to get root level keys
      - preindexed data
  - InstantSearch adpater
    - https://github.com/unplatform-io/instantsearch-itemsjs-adapter/blob/main/src/adapter.ts
    - https://github.com/typesense/typesense-instantsearch-adapter/blob/master/src/TypesenseInstantsearchAdapter.js
  - demo with table / cards
  - query string parser
  - demo with graph?
  - alternative solutions
    - test CSV instead of JSON (memory footprint)
    - memoize sort order in `TypedArray` (Int16)
