### Snippeting doesn't work

See: `helpers.snippet` in `Products.ts`.

It should cut first N words. It requires primitive tokenizer, plus it should try to show text with matched parts.

```js
request.params.attributesToSnippet = ["description:10"];
```

```json
{
  "_snippetResult": {
    "description": {
      "value": "Enjoy smart access to videos, games and apps with this â€¦",
      "matchLevel": "none"
    }
  }
}
```
